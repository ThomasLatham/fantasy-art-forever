# Fantasy Art Forever

This is a project for posting fantasy art to Instagram in an automated fashion, sourcing works from
the [Imaginary Network Expanded](https://old.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryBestOf/wiki/networksublist), a
family of Reddit communities (i.e., subreddits) for sharing and discussing art while maintaining
artist credit. As such, this project also keeps high standards for artist and poster attribution.
