# Fantasy Art Forever
This is a project for posting fantasy art to Instagram daily in an automated fashion, sourcing works
from the [Imaginary Network Expanded](https://old.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryBestOf/wiki/networksublist),
a family of Reddit communities (i.e., subreddits) for sharing and discussing art while maintaining
artist credit. As such, this project also keeps high standards for artist and poster attribution.

*A note for transparency:* This bot in its current state ignores OC (original content) posts on the
subreddits it scrapes. This is because it's difficult to automate attribution for these posts; while
regular posts need to have artist's name in their titles, OC posts don't have this requirement, so
it's harder (but not impossible) to automate finding the artist's name. I might add this in a future
version.

## How It Works

### Sourcing Posts from Reddit
We persist a queue of future Instagram posts such that for every subreddit from which we source
content we always have 1 post queued up and 2 posts as backups. 

When a queued post for some subreddit is used for an Instagram post, that post is removed from the
queue, and the oldest backup post for that subreddit takes its place. The backup posts are
"refilled" periodically â€” every 6 hours a script runs which checks for missing backups and replaces
them with the top post of the week from the correct subreddit.

The post queue was initialized with the top 3 posts of all time from each sourcing subreddit.

### Posting to Instagram
Once a day, we post to Instagram according to the above posting schedule.

If post creation fails due to something about the sourced Reddit post, then we try posting with the
oldest backup. If it succeeds then we dequeue both the succeeding backup and the failing queued
post. If the backup fails due to something about the sourced Reddit post, then we try with the other
backup, dequeuing all 3 in case of success or Reddit-post-induced failure.

The time of day Instagram posts are made is randomized between 5 different times: 6 am, 9 am, 12 pm,
3 pm and 6 pm (all Eastern Time).
